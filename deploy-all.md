## Universal Engine Support Strategy

Is it also possible to implement support for all games that use these engines, beyond just the specific ones we currently target? This would allow us to potentially support 500+ games or similar scale.

### Cross-Engine Compatibility Goals
- Implement universal adapters for major game engines
- Create generic hooks that work across engine versions
- Develop automated detection and adaptation systems
- Enable broad game compatibility without manual per-game configuration

### Feasibility & Scope
- Universal support is achievable via engine-level adapters, not per-title hacks.
- Expect phased rollout: start with REDengine 4, RE Engine, MT-Framework; add Unreal/Unity after stable scaffolding.
- Legal/anti-cheat constraints: avoid online competitive titles; enable a safe-mode for unknown builds.

### Compatibility Tiers
- Tier 0: Not detected/blocked (no hooks).
- Tier 1: Boot + basic camera pose (no UI, flat view).
- Tier 2: Stereo + head-tracked camera + FOV control.
- Tier 3: Input remap + HUD transforms + basic 6DoF.
- Tier 4: Full VR integration (stereo rendering, hands, UI reprojection).
- Tier 5: Enhanced features (DLSS/FSR path, neural interpolation, reprojection).

### Detection & Adapter Architecture
- EngineDetector: hashes/process heuristics to identify engine/version at runtime.
- Capability discovery: probe graphics API, constant buffers, swapchain, shaders.
- Adapter schema (profiles/*/adapter.json): declare hook_points, matrices, input mapping, feature flags.
- Shared probe module: reusable constant-buffer logger to map view/projection cb_slot/offsets.
- Safety: blacklist/kill-switch and offline-only default for risky titles.

### Implementation Plan (incremental)
- Milestone A: Finalize adapter.schema.json + profiles/_TEMPLATE/adapter.json; implement EngineDetector; wire capability discovery into BaseCrossEngineAdapter.
- Milestone B: Generalize CB probe; validate on RE7 baseline capture; update profiles/re7/adapter.json with real cb_slot/offsets.
- Milestone C: Bring up Cyberpunk 2077 (REDengine 4) and Monster Hunter: World (MT-Framework) to Tier 2.
- Milestone D: Add Unreal/Unity generic hooks (UE4/5, IL2CPP/Mono) behind safe-mode.

### Reporting
- Auto-generate docs/reports/CompatibilityMatrix.md from profiles/*/adapter.json.
- Per-game artifacts: RenderDoc baseline capture path and persistent uobjecthook JSON, plus probe logs.

### Engine Flexing Strategies

#### For Cyberpunk 2077 (REDengine 4)
- Neural network-based frame interpolation
- Dynamic resolution scaling with temporal upsampling
- Advanced ray-tracing to rasterization fallback
- Custom REDscript integration for mod compatibility

#### For RE4/RE8 (RE Engine)
- Motion blur to 120Hz adaptation
- Dynamic FOV expansion for VR comfort

### Implementation Considerations
- Engine-agnostic VR integration patterns
- Generic rendering pipeline hooks
- Universal input mapping systems
- Scalable plugin architecture for mass deployment
- Automated compatibility reporting (profiles/*/adapter.json -> docs/reports/CompatibilityMatrix.md)
