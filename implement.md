## Plan / Workflow

1) Compatibility and Target Selection
   - Open the compatibility spreadsheet and filter for UE4/UE5 titles confirmed working.
   - Record the exact Windows executable name (e.g., MyGame-Win64-Shipping.exe) to name the profile folder.
   - Replace the two TBD targets in this file once selected.

2) First Run and Baseline Capture
   - Launch the game via `uevrInjector.exe` and hook the process.
   - Open the uevr menu, keep defaults initially, then save profile to generate `profiles/<GameExeName>/` with `config.txt` and `cameras.txt`.

3) Camera and Scale Configuration
   - Tune `world_scale*` and decoupled pitch in `cameras.txt`.
   - Adjust camera offsets to align HMD with character head.

4) Core VR Settings (`config.txt`)
   - Ensure: `VR_ControllersAllowed=true`, `VR_RoomscaleMovement=true`, `VR_AimMethod=2`, `VR_UncapFramerate=true`.
   - Set OpenXR runtime, resolution scale, snap turn prefs, joystick deadzone, overlays.

5) Controller Attachments and UObject Mapping
   - Ensure `UObjectHook_EnabledAtStartup=true` in `config.txt` (see reference profile).
   - In-game steps:
     - Enable Advanced Options in the uevr menu.
     - Go to `UObjectHook` > `Common Objects` > `Acknowledged Pawn` > `Components`.
     - Select the target `SkeletalMeshComponent` (e.g., weapon, hands) or relevant component (e.g., wrist UI widget).
     - Click "Attach right" or "Attach left". Then click "Adjust", close the menu, and align the controller with the in-game item. Reopen the menu.
     - Click "Permanent Change" if you need projectiles/colliders to originate correctly.
     - Click "Save State" to persist across sessions.
   - Input alignment:
     - Set `Aim Method` to `Left Controller` or `Right Controller` under `Input` to match your attachment.
   - Mirror the approach used in `profiles/AbioticFactor-Win64-Shipping/` (weapon to right, wristwatch to left).

6) Validation
   - Test aiming, locomotion, UI readability, interaction reach, comfort (turning), and performance.
   - Iterate until parity with the reference profile quality is achieved.

7) Artifacts and Documentation
   - Commit `config.txt`, `cameras.txt`, and a short `README.md` describing any special notes per game.
   - Include before/after notes and any caveats in interactions.

## Maintenance & Update Testing

- After game updates, re-validate: injection, camera alignment, UObjectHook attachments, input aim method.
- Keep a changelog of any tweaks made post-update.
- Back up `profiles/<GameExeName>/uobjecthook/` before experimenting.
- If attachments break, re-run: Attach → Adjust → Permanent Change → Save State.

## Reusable Profile Template

Copy the `_TEMPLATE` folder in `profiles/` and rename to your game's executable base name (e.g., `MyGame-Win64-Shipping`). Then refine values in-game.

## Per-Game README Template

Create `profiles/<GameExeName>/README.md` using this template:

```markdown
# <Game Title> — uevr Profile

## Executable
- `<GameExeName>.exe`

## Runtime
- OpenXR/OpenVR, resolution scale: <value>

## Camera
- World scale: <value>
- Decoupled pitch: true/false
- Offsets: forward/right/up = <values>

## Controls
- Aim Method: Left/Right Controller
- Snap turn: on/off, angle <deg>
- Deadzone: <value>

## UObjectHook Attachments
- <Component Path> → Left/Right controller
- Permanent Change: true/false
- Notes: offsets/quaternion if manually set

## Known Quirks
- <shader/cvar tweaks, UI notes, comfort suggestions>

## Validation
- Aiming/Locomotion/UI/Performance/Audio/Comfort results summary

## Last Verified
- Game version <x.y>, uevr build <hash/vers>
```

## UObjectHook Persistent State (reference)

- Saved under `profiles/<GameExeName>/uobjecthook/`.
- Types:
  - `*_mc_state.json`: motion controller attachment state
  - `*_props.json`: property visibility/edits

Example `*_mc_state.json` (from `profiles/AbioticFactor-Win64-Shipping/uobjecthook/`):

```json
{
  "path": ["Acknowledged Pawn", "Components", "WidgetComponent Wristwatch"],
  "type": "motion_controller",
  "state": {
    "hand": 0,
    "location_offset": {"x": 0.0, "y": 0.0, "z": 0.0},
    "rotation_offset": {"w": 0.0685, "x": 0.0175, "y": 0.9665, "z": -0.2468},
    "permanent": true
  }
}
```

Notes:
- `hand`: 0 = left, 1 = right, 2 = HMD.
- Use "Permanent Change" when you need projectiles/colliders to originate correctly.
- Always "Save State" after adjustments.

## Common UObjectHook Targets (hints)

- Look under `Common Objects` → `Acknowledged Pawn` → `Components`.
- Typical weapon meshes: `SkeletalMeshComponent FP_Gun`, `Mesh2P`, or similar.
- Wrist/utility UI often appears as `WidgetComponent <Name>`.
- If multiple meshes exist, toggle `Visible` to identify the right one before attaching.

## Notes: Non‑UE Games

- uevr targets Unreal Engine titles. Non‑UE games (e.g., Cyberpunk 2077, Resident Evil VII) are not compatible.

## Next Actions

- Use the compatibility sheet to pick two supported UE games and replace the TBD entries above.
- Duplicate `profiles/_TEMPLATE` to each new game folder and begin tuning in-game.
- Review uevr compatibility spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZcjCQwzPOltaRZnpYU5_HPihEDareZq_0Ww1DZQ4USw/htmlview#
- Document UObject attachments and any per-title quirks in each game’s README.




- For detailed implementation steps, refer to [implement.md](implement.md) and follow the artifacts structure as outlined.
- When configuring a new profile, consult the relevant section in [implement.md](implement.md) for exact folder and file placement.
- If you encounter issues or need to pause, document your current progress in `profiles/<Game-ExeName>/README.md` and review [implement.md](implement.md) before resuming.
- For game-specific quirks or UObject attachments, always update both the local game README and cross-reference with [implement.md](implement.md) for consistency.
- Need to verify a step? Deep-dive into context7 and the compatibility spreadsheet as referenced in [implement.md](implement.md) for guidance.
- If uncertain how to proceed, stop and read all instructions in [implement.md](implement.md) to ensure correct implementation before continuing.

## Resume Development Prompt

**CRITICAL CONTINUATION CHECKPOINT**

You are continuing uevr profile development with complete systematic execution. Maintain all previous progress and data from your current session. Read and implement everything from @implement.md

**CURRENT STATUS VERIFICATION:**
- [ ] Two target games selected from compatibility sheet? (Names: _______ & _______)
- [ ] Baseline profiles created via uevrInjector.exe?
- [ ] Camera tuning completed in cameras.txt?
- [ ] Core VR settings configured in config.txt?
- [ ] UObjectHook attachments performed and saved?
- [ ] Input alignment (Aim Method) set to match controller attachments?
- [ ] Validation testing completed (aiming/locomotion/UI/performance)?
- [ ] README.md documentation written per game?

**IMMEDIATE EXECUTION PROTOCOL:**
1. Identify the first unchecked item above
2. Execute that specific step using implement.md sections 1-7
3. Mark complete and proceed to next unchecked item
4. Document all changes immediately

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**
- Use exact executable names for profile folders (e.g., `GameName-Win64-Shipping`)
- Execute "Save State" after every UObjectHook adjustment
- Implement weapon→right controller, utility→left controller attachments
- Document all UObject attachment paths in per-game README
- Maintain strict artifacts structure per implement.md specification

**FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:**
- Restarting development from beginning
- Skipping any validation steps
- Omitting UObject attachment path documentation
- Bypassing performance/comfort testing phases
- Deviating from established folder structure

**REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION:**
- Template Structure: `profiles/_TEMPLATE/README.md`
- Working Example: `profiles/AbioticFactor-Win64-Shipping/`
- Complete Workflow: `implement.md` sections 1-7
- Compatibility Data: uevr compatibility spreadsheet
