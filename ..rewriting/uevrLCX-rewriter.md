🌍 **UEVR-LCS Master Framework (Unified)**

🔑 **Core Principles**

- **No Fragmentation** → All plans, roadmaps, and resources live inside one coherent tree.  
- **Context7 Perfect** → Structured, layered, contextual breakdown of every item.  
- **DeepWiki Perfect** → In-depth, cross-linked technical explanations.  
- **Recursive Boosting** → Context7 enriches DeepWiki, DeepWiki enriches Context7.  

Together, they form a self-reinforcing documentation system for every part.

🎯 **Master Plan & Prompt for Universal VR Conversion (UEVR+LCS Project)**

🔑 **Core Objective**

Develop a unified VR conversion system (UEVR+ Plugin Extender) capable of transforming any flat PC game into a fully functional, aesthetic VR experience, featuring:

- ✅ **Collision Realism** → True 3D presence, not just fake depth.  
- ✅ **Universal Compatibility** → Works with any game engine, old or unsupported.  
- ✅ **Converter-Transformer Module** → Handles game-to-VR translation dynamically, with adaptive tuning per game.  
- ✅ **Integrated Toolchain** → Consolidates all known VR hacks, wrappers, injectors, shader mods into one coherent system.  

This project is the convergence point of all existing fragmented solutions.

🗂 **Project Folder Structure**

- Include all existing files, plans, roadmaps, and the generated full `@extended-resources/List.txt`.  
- Extend the list with additional high-quality resources to avoid rebuilding from scratch—allowing direct modification and integration into the UEVR+LCS project.
