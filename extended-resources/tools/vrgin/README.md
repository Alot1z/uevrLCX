# VRGIN Integration

- Use VRGIN/VRGIN.NET for Unity titles with managed injection.
- Lifecycle: initialize after scene load; implement VRGIN-like callbacks in native path for parity.
- Map VRGIN camera rig to OpenXR spaces; redirect input through `InputMapper`.
- See: https://github.com/Eusth/VRGIN and https://github.com/BlueSkyDefender/VRGIN.NET
