    virtual PatternMatrix SynthesizePatterns(const std::vector<Domain>& domains) = 0;
    
    // Cross-reference validation against multiple knowledge bases
    virtual ValidationResult ValidateAgainstKnowledgeBases(const Research& research) = 0;
    
    // Innovation opportunity identification through pattern analysis
    virtual InnovationVector IdentifyInnovationOpportunities(const PatternMatrix& patterns) = 0;
};
```
