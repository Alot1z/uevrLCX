## Technical Architecture

### Plugin System Extension

The cross-engine adapters extend uevr's plugin system through:

1. **Inheritance from `uevr::Plugin`**: Provides access to uevr's callback system
2. **MinHook Integration**: Enables DirectX function interception
3. **Engine-Specific State Management**: Tracks engine-specific rendering state
4. **VR Pipeline Integration**: Connects to uevr's stereo rendering and motion controller systems

### Hook Implementation Strategy

#### D3D11 Engines (RE Engine, MT Framework)
```cpp
// Hook IDXGISwapChain::Present (vtable index 8)
// Hook IDXGISwapChain::ResizeBuffers (vtable index 13)
```

#### D3D12 Engines (REDengine 4)
```cpp
// Hook IDXGISwapChain3::Present1 (vtable index 22)
// Hook ID3D12CommandQueue::ExecuteCommandLists (vtable index 10)
```

### Matrix Extraction Framework

Each adapter implements a framework for extracting camera matrices:

1. **Constant Buffer Analysis**: Identifies buffer slots containing view/projection matrices
2. **Matrix Layout Handling**: Supports different matrix formats (row/column major, handedness)
3. **VR Transformation**: Converts extracted matrices for VR stereo rendering
4. **Performance Optimization**: Caches matrices to minimize extraction overhead

## Implementation Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Engine Detection
**Problem**: Reliable runtime detection of target engines
**Solution**: Executable name scanning combined with rendering pipeline analysis

### Challenge 2: Matrix Extraction
**Problem**: Identifying correct constant buffer slots and offsets
**Solution**: RenderDoc analysis framework with placeholder implementation for future completion

### Challenge 3: Hook Installation
**Problem**: Installing hooks without access to target swapchain
**Solution**: Temporary swapchain creation for vtable resolution

### Challenge 4: VR Integration
**Problem**: Integrating with uevr's VR pipeline
**Solution**: Plugin callback system providing access to post-render hooks
