## Development Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: uevr Unreal Engine Dependency
**Problem:** uevr is fundamentally designed for Unreal Engine games
**Solution:** Created custom cross-engine adapter framework that extends uevr's plugin architecture

### Challenge 2: Engine-Specific Rendering Pipelines
**Problem:** Different engines use different graphics APIs and rendering approaches
**Solution:** Implemented engine-specific detection and adaptation layers with universal abstraction

### Challenge 3: Cross-Engine Consistency
**Problem:** Maintaining consistent VR experience across different game engines
**Solution:** Developed universal frameworks for UI, controllers, memory, and performance
