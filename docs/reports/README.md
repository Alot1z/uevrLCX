# Reports â€” How to Document Progress

Use one report per game in this folder. Keep sections short and evidence-backed.

Sections to maintain:
- Summary: integration path, current status
- Captures: RenderDoc links and timestamps
- Matrices: CB slots/offsets, layout, validation notes
- Attachments: component paths, controller side, permanent, offsets/quats
- Input: aim method and bindings
- UI: projection technique and overrides
- Performance: FPS, frame pacing, resolution scale
- Validation: aiming, locomotion, UI, comfort, audio
- Notes: quirks, TODOs, risks

Start from `_TEMPLATE_REPORT.md`.
