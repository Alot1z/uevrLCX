# Purpose
A curated documentation collection that is easy for humans to read and reliable for machines to index. Built to avoid generic, low-signal content and to anchor every claim to code or process.

# Contents
- Overview and principles
- Architecture and components
- Adapters, runtimes, and input
- Implementation guides, reference, and playbooks
- Knowledge and research maps (DeepWiki/Context7)

# Conventions
- Short paragraphs, concrete statements, verifiable references.
- Keep `last_verified` updated in each PR.
- Use cross-links to code (paths) and related docs.
