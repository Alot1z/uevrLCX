Plan Specification

Actionable Plan (Concise)

Goals
- Make the system 100% understandable end-to-end.
- Keep all good/necessary links, add substantial new material.
- Align root `README.md` with a structured DeepWiki and cross-links.

Scope
- In: Root README overhaul, new deep docs, link preservation, validations.
- Out: Code refactors (unless required for docs), non-Windows builds.

Primary Deliverables
- Root: `README.md` (expanded), references to `README_COMPLETE_SYSTEM.md`, `STRUCTURE_README.md`, `README_UEVR_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
- DeepWiki core: `requirements.md`, `vr-integration.md`, `functions.md`, `files-index.md`.
- New deep docs: `GETTING_STARTED_COMPLETE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_DEEP_DIVE.md`, `GAME_ENGINE_SUPPORT.md`, `BUILD_SYSTEM_COMPLETE.md`, `API_REFERENCE_COMPLETE.md`, `TESTING_VALIDATION_COMPLETE.md`, `DEPLOYMENT_PRODUCTION.md`, `TROUBLESHOOTING_COMPLETE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING_COMPLETE.md`, `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md`, `SECURITY_BEST_PRACTICES.md`, `COMMUNITY_RESOURCES.md`, `ROADMAP_DETAILED.md`, `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`.

Phase Plan & Checklists
- Phase 0 — Audit & Baseline (Day 0–1)
  - [ ] Review root docs: `../../README_COMPLETE_SYSTEM.md`, `../../STRUCTURE_README.md`, `../../README_UEVR_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
  - [ ] Review DeepWiki: `README.md`, `files-index.md`, `functions.md`, `requirements.md`, `vr-integration.md`.
  - [ ] Map existing links to be preserved; list gaps (arch, testing, API, performance, security).

- Phase 1 — Skeletons & ToC (Day 1–2)
  - [ ] Add empty, linked stubs for all new docs listed above.
  - [ ] Insert ToC entries in `docs/deepwiki/README.md` to each new page.
  - [ ] Add "WIP" banners + acceptance criteria sections to each stub.

- Phase 2 — Authoring (Rolling, per doc)
  - [ ] Getting Started (install paths, first run, dev setup) — sources: build scripts, `cmake.toml`.
  - [ ] Architecture Deep Dive (components, lifecycles, diagrams) — sources: `include/uevr/*`, `src/*`.
  - [ ] Game Engine Support (MT-Framework, RE-Engine, REDengine4, Unreal, Unity) — sources: `docs/cross-engine/*`, `adapters/*`.
  - [ ] Build System Complete — sources: `docs/build_system/ultra_advanced_build_system_guide.md`, root build scripts.
  - [ ] API Reference — index public headers in `include/uevr/` and key `src/` entry points.
  - [ ] Testing & Validation — sources: `tests/`, `test_*.ps1`, CI workflows.
  - [ ] Deployment & Production — user vs dev packages, configuration, updates.
  - [ ] Troubleshooting — common issues, diagnostics, platform notes.
  - [ ] Contributing — workflows, style, PR checks, security.
  - [ ] Performance Optimization — profiling, per-engine tips, VR specifics.
  - [ ] Security Best Practices — threat model, sandboxing, updates.
  - [ ] Community Resources — support channels, tutorials, links.
  - [ ] Roadmap Detailed — phases, goals, voting, feasibility.
  - [ ] Quick Reference — commands, config, error codes.

- Phase 3 — Integration & Validation (After each doc)
  - [ ] Cross-link every new section back to root `README.md` and DeepWiki index.
  - [ ] Validate links with a Markdown link checker.
  - [ ] Run style linters (`.clang-format` for code snippets consistency where applicable).

- Phase 4 — Review & Release
  - [ ] Peer review for technical accuracy (adapter owners per engine).
  - [ ] Update `docs/compatibility/README.md` and cross-engine pages if impacted.
  - [ ] Tag release; publish docs site (mdBook/GitHub Pages if configured).
