# Cyberpunk 2077 Baseline RenderDoc Capture
# 
# This is a placeholder file for the actual .rdc capture
# 
# To generate the real capture:
# 1. Launch Cyberpunk 2077 in flat screen mode
# 2. Start RenderDoc and attach to the game process
# 3. Navigate to main menu or early game scene
# 4. Begin capture and let it run for 30-60 seconds
# 5. Save capture as cp2077_baseline.rdc
# 
# The actual .rdc file will be a binary file containing:
# - D3D12 command list data
# - Rendering pipeline information
# - Camera matrices and transforms
# - Object rendering data
# - Memory allocation patterns
# 
# This capture is essential for:
# - Understanding REDengine 4's rendering pipeline
# - Identifying hook points for VR integration
# - Extracting camera matrices for VR transformation
# - Analyzing performance characteristics
# 
# File size: Typically 50-200 MB depending on capture duration
# Format: RenderDoc binary format (.rdc)
# 
# Status: Placeholder - requires actual game capture
